# unity-game-MortalEngines
A unity Stealth 2D Platformer demo game I originally made for a college project. Inspired by the post apocilypic Book and film "Mortal Engines".

Game Flow:
- Visit South African Cities set in a Mortal Engines inspired universe.
- Complete puzzles to gain loot and unlock new cities.
- Completing all cities grants the player a key that opens new rooms in each city.
- Find these new rooms to complete the game.

Mechanics:
- Avoid being detected by the city guards.
- Crouch and Crawl to get through small gaps and move undetected.
- Find the alarm switch to disable the alarm or you won't have enough time to loot everything.
- Find the door computer to unlock all loot room doors.
- Exit the city the same way you entered.

Development Period:
Part-time for 3 Weeks.

Tools:
1. Unity 3D
2. Unity Visual Scripting
3. Photoshop
4. Illustrator
5. Fl Studios
